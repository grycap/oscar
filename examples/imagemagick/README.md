# Image Conversion to Grayscale with ImageMagick

You can follow the very same procedure described for the [plant-classification](https://github.com/grycap/oscar/tree/master/examples/plant-classification-theano) example with the following information:

* Docker Image: [grycap-imagemagick](https://hub.docker.com/r/grycap/imagemagick/)
* Script: The `script.sh` file in this directory.

Whenever you upload a file to the input bucket it will be automatically converted to grayscale and made available in the output bucket.
