# OSCAR Function: Thunderstorm Nowcast Microstep Prediction

This OSCAR function executes the "thunderstorm nowcast microstep" prediction model using the `ai4oshub/thunderstorm-nowcast-microstep` Docker image. It is configured to process data (based on its internal configuration) and save the output files generated by the application to a MinIO bucket.

## Deployment

Deployment of this function is performed like any other synchronous or asynchronous OSCAR service. The necessary files are the FDL descriptor (`thunderstorm-function.yaml`) and the execution script (`script.sh`).

To deploy this service through the **OSCAR-CLI**, you just need to place the `thunderstorm-function.yaml` and `script.sh` files in the same folder and run:

```bash
oscar-cli apply thunderstorm-function.yaml
