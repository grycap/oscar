# OSCAR Examples

This folder includes different use cases of applications that use the OSCAR framework for event-driven high-throughput processing of files:

* [Plants Classification](https://github.com/indigo-dc/plant-classification-theano), an application that performs plant classification using Lasagne/Theano.  
* [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org), a tool to manipulate images.
