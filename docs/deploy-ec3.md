# Deployment with EC3

> ❗️
> The deployment of OSCAR with EC3 is deprecated. Please, consider using the [IM Dashboard](deploy-im-dashboard.md).

In order to deploy an elastic Kubernetes cluster with the OSCAR platform, it
is preferable to use the
[IM Dashboard](https://im.egi.eu). 
Alternatively, you can also use [EC3](https://github.com/grycap/ec3), a tool
that deploys elastic virtual clusters. EC3 uses the
[Infrastructure Manager (IM)](https://www.grycap.upv.es/im) to deploy such
clusters on multiple Cloud back-ends. The installation details can be found
[here](https://ec3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installation), though
this section includes the relevant information to get you started.

## Prepare EC3

Clone the EC3 repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/grycap/ec3
```

Download the OSCAR template into the `ec3/templates` folder:

```
cd ec3
wget -P templates https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grycap/oscar/master/templates/oscar.radl
```

Create an `auth.txt`
[authorization file](https://ec3.readthedocs.io/en/devel/ec3.html#authorization-file)
with valid credentials to access your Cloud provider. As an example, to deploy
on an OpenNebula-based Cloud site the contents of the file would be:

```
type = OpenNebula; host = opennebula-host:2633;
username = your-user;
password = you-password
```

Modify the corresponding
[RADL](https://imdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/radl.html#resource-and-application-description-language-radl)
template in order to determine the appropriate configuration for your
deployment:

- Virtual Machine Image identifiers
- Hardware Configuration

As an example, to deploy in OpenNebula, one would modify the
`ubuntu-opennebula.radl` (or create a new one).

## Deploy the cluster

To deploy the cluster, execute:

```
./ec3 launch oscar-cluster oscar ubuntu-opennebula -a auth.txt
```

This will take several minutes until the Kubernetes cluster and all the
required services have been deployed. You will obtain the IP of the front-end
of the cluster and a confirmation message that the front-end is ready. Notice
that it will still take few minutes before the services in the Kubernetes
cluster are up & running.

### Check the cluster state

The cluster will be fully configured when all the Kubernetes pods are in the
`Running` state.

```
 ./ec3 ssh oscar-cluster
 sudo kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

Notice that initially only the front-end node of the cluster is deployed.
As soon as the OSCAR framework is deployed, together with its services, the
CLUES elasticity manager powers on a new (working) node on which these
services will be run.

You can see the status of the provisioned node(s) by issuing:

```
 clues status
```

which obtains:

```
| node            |state| enabled |time stable|(cpu,mem) used |(cpu,mem) total|
|-----------------|-----|---------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| wn1.localdomain | used| enabled | 00h00'49" | 0.0,825229312 | 1,1992404992  |
| wn2.localdomain | off | enabled | 00h06'43" | 0,0           | 1,1073741824  |
| wn3.localdomain | off | enabled | 00h06'43" | 0,0           | 1,1073741824  |
| wn4.localdomain | off | enabled | 00h06'43" | 0,0           | 1,1073741824  |
| wn5.localdomain | off | enabled | 00h06'43" | 0,0           | 1,1073741824  |
```

The working nodes transition from `off` to `powon` and, finally, to the `used` status.

## Default Service Endpoints

Once the OSCAR framework is running on the Kubernetes cluster, the endpoints
described in the following table should be available.
Most of the passwords/tokens are dynamically generated at deployment time and
made available in the `/var/tmp` folder of the front-end node of the cluster.

| Service        | Endpoint                  | Default User | Password File   |
|----------------|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| OSCAR          | https://{FRONT_NODE}      | oscar        | oscar_password  |
| MinIO          | https://{FRONT_NODE}:30300| minio        | minio_secret_key|
| OpenFaaS       | http://{FRONT_NODE}:31112 | admin        | gw_password     |
| Kubernetes API | https://{FRONT_NODE}:6443 |              | tokenpass       |
| Kube. Dashboard| https://{FRONT_NODE}:30443|              | dashboard_token |

Note that `{FRONT_NODE}` refers to the public IP of the front-end of the
Kubernetes cluster.

For example, to get the OSCAR password, you can execute:

```
./ec3 ssh oscar-cluster cat /var/tmp/oscar_password
```
